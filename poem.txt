Whispers of a Cat 

Soft as twilight, a shadow slips,  
Whiskers quivering, paws in tips.  
Eyes like moons in the midnight glow,  
A secret world only felines know.  

They prowl through realms of quiet grace,  
Claiming every hidden space.  
A gentle purr, a tender hum,  
A lullaby when the day is done.  

With fur that traps the sunlit beams,  
They wander freely in their dreams.  
Hunters fierce, yet hearts so pure,  
A mystery no love can cure.  

Oh, regal creature, sly and spry,  
Master of earth, watcher of sky.  
In your presence, the world feels small,  
For in your gaze, you hold it all. 

They teach us patience, teach us care,
To find delight in the subtle air.
A paw on hand, a nuzzle near,
They mend the cracks, dissolve our fear.
